# Caesar Cipher

A Caesar cipher involves shifting each character in a plaintext by three letters forward:
A -> D, B -> E, C -> F, etc... 
At the end of the alphabet, the cipher mapping wraps around the end, so:
..., X -> A, Y -> B, Z -> C.

In the Caesar Cipher algrythm we need to shift every character by 3 letters forward (encrypt) or 3 letters back (decrypt).


# Vigenere Cipher

A Vigenere cipher is similar in nature to a Caesar cipher. However, in a Vigenere cipher, every character in the plaintext can be shifted by a variable amount. The amount to shift any letter in the plaintext is determined by a keyword, where 'A' corresponds to shift of 0 (no shift), 'B' corresponds to a shift of 1, ..., and 'Z' corresponds to a shift of 25, wrapping around if necessary (as with the Caesar cipher).
The keyword is repeated or truncated as necessary to fit the length of the plaintext. 

We create an array of shifted values for the text and the keyword and then we shift forward(encrypt) or backward(decrypt) every character by this variable amount.


# Scytale Cipher

We create a scytale(table), where the number of rows is equal to the circumference, and then we write the message diagonally down (around) the scytale.
The ciphertext is then obtained by reading from left to right, top to bottom.

# Railfence Cipher

In this algorythm we create a grid where the number of rows is equal to the number of rails, and we write the text in Zig-Zag (top to buttomand then bottom to top etc.)
The ciphertext is obtained by reading the rails from left to right, top to bottom.
