    """Generate a private key to use with the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem.

    Following the instructions in the handout, construct the private key
    components of the MH Cryptosystem. This consists of 3 tasks:

    1. Build a superincreasing sequence `w` of length n
        Note: You can double-check that a sequence is superincreasing by using:
            `utils.is_superincreasing(seq)`
    2. Choose some integer `q` greater than the sum of all elements in `w`
    3. Discover an integer `r` between 2 and q that is coprime to `q`
        Note: You can use `utils.coprime(r, q)` for this.

    You'll also need to use the random module's `randint` function, which you
    will have to import.

    Somehow, you'll have to return all three of these values from this function!
    Can we do that in Python?!

    Following the outline of the handout, you will need to:
    1. Separate the message into chunks based on the size of the public key.
        In our case, that's the fixed value n = 8, corresponding to a single
        byte. In principle, we should work for any value of n, but we'll
        assert that it's fine to operate byte-by-byte.
    2. For each byte, determine its 8 bits (the `a_i`s). You can use
        `utils.byte_to_bits(byte)`.
    3. Encrypt the 8 message bits by computing
         c = sum of a_i * b_i for i = 1 to n
    4. Return a list of the encrypted ciphertexts for each chunk of the message.

    Hint: Think about using `zip` and other tools we've discussed in class.
